# Data-Science-Project
I have used multiple Supervised Learning Algorithms for classification purposes, for Fashion MNIST dataset.
Used Classification report and confusion matrix for determining the accuracy of the model.
Build AUC and ROC curve.
Finally, used my own clicked images, to check the accuracy of the model and determining its predicting power.
