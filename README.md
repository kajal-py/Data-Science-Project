# Machine Learning Algorithm on Fashion MNIST Dataset
1. Normalizing train and test dataset before feeding in the model. 
2. Visualizing gray scale images of training data.
3. Deploying feature extraction/ dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis to capture features defining maximum variation in the dataset.
4. Deploying multiple Machine Learning Algorithm including Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and calculated accuracy, F-1 score and compared against each other.
5. Visualized the test dataset for each model to confirm the accuracy.
6. Used raw images at the end, to determine the final accuracy of model. 
7. Using the previously used ML model with highest accuracy to calculate the accuracy of raw images.
8. Final accuracy > 72%. 
9. Visualized Final Images and determined model prediction power.
